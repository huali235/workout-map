# Workout Map

## Description

The application allows users to log their workouts with specific details. For running workouts, users can log the distance, duration, coordinates, and cadence. Each workout is associated with a date and a description, which is automatically generated based on the type of workout and the date it was logged. The application also uses the Leaflet.js library to display a map and place a marker for each workout.

## Languages and Libraries Used

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The application is entirely written in JavaScript, using modern ES6+ syntax. This includes the use of classes, inheritance, and other OOP principles.

- **Leaflet.js**: This library is used to display interactive maps and place markers for each workout.

- **Date Object**: The application uses JavaScript's built-in Date object to manage and manipulate dates.
